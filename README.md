## Introduction

Kiruna eXplorer is a specialized web application designed to document, map, and visualize the unprecedented relocation of the city of Kiruna, Sweden. Due to the expansion of the Kiirunavaara mine, the world's largest underground iron ore mine, the city is undergoing a massive urban metamorphosis between 2004 and 2035 to avoid the expanding landslide and deformation zones.

The project serves as a "hypertext of stories," linking legal documents, architectural plans, and material effects (demolition, moving, and construction) to help stakeholders understand the city's evolution.

 ### Core Functionalities

- **Interactive Spatial Mapping**: Georeference documents and urban actions directly on a satellite map to study their relationship with the territory.
- **The Cartesian Diagram**: A unique UI component that organizes documents and material effects on a time-scale axis, visualizing the "urban metamorphosis" process.
- **Traceability of Consequences**: Visualize direct and collateral consequences between nodes, such as how a deformation forecast leads to a specific municipal agreement or a demolition action.
- **Multi-Stakeholder Support**: Tailored for Urban Planners (detailed planning), Residents (assessing personal impact), and Visitors (learning the history).

### Development & Quality Assurance

While the primary stack is visible in the repository tags, the project leverages a robust software engineering infrastructure:

- **Containerization**: Fully deployable via Docker, ensuring that the entire environment (including database and instructions) is cross-platform compatible.
- **Quality & Debt Management**: Continuous code analysis performed via SonarCloud to track technical debt and ensure code maintainability.
- **Agile Methodology**: Developed using Scrum framework, with task tracking, estimation (Story Points), and sprint planning performed via YouTrack.

## Getting started

In order to get the system up and running you need to:

1. Create a `.env.prod` file in the root directory of the repository, like the following:

```
SECRET=kirunaProdSecret
POSTGRES_USER=admin
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin
POSTGRES_DB=kiruna-db
POSTGRES_SERVICE=db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

2. Execute the following command, always from the root:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up
```

This will start all the containers and, in a few seconds, it will be possible to access the website at the address `http://localhost:8080`.

### Stop the services

In order to stop the containers (without losing data), execute:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod down
```

If you want to both stop the services and erase all data, append the `-v` flag:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod down -v
```

### Default users

There are two default users:

- John, a `Urban Planner` (email: `john@kiruna.com`, password: `12345`)
- Kevin, a `Resident` (email: `kevin@kiruna.com`, password: `12345`)

## Development environment setup

### DB initialization

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository, like the following:

```
SECRET=kirunasecret
POSTGRES_USER=kiruna
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=explorer
POSTGRES_DB=kiruna-db
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

PGADMIN_EMAIL=kiruna@explorer.com
PGADMIN_PASSWORD=kiruna
```

2. Start the containers with `docker compose up -d`.

3. Connect to pgAdmin web interface at the `localhost:5050` address.

4. Add a new connection to the DB (inside the **hostname** field insert `db`).
5. To stop the containers, run `docker compose down`; if you also want to delete the local database data, execute `docker compose down -v`.

### Test setup

1. Create a `.env.test` file in the root directory of the repository, like the following:

```
SECRET=kirunasecret
POSTGRES_USER=kiruna
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=explorer
POSTGRES_DB=kiruna-db
POSTGRES_PORT=5435
```

2. Start the database test container with `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml --env-file .env.test up -d`.

3. Run the tests with: `npm run test`.

   > if the database schema inside the container is not updated, stop the container with the command below and execute: `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml --env-file .env.test up -d --build`.

4. To stop and delete the database test container, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down -v`.
